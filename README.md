Clouder is a platform which aim to standardize good practices for hosting open-source software. Whether you are launching a hosting offer, are the sysadmin of a company, or just want to host software for you and your friends, Clouder will allow you to easily deploy and maintain a professionnal infrastructure with very basic technical knowledge.

More specifically, it is an orchestrator which is based on container technology (currently only supports Docker), each application will be installed inside a container and Clouder will establish links between them. It is based on Odoo, an open-source software application which is very efficient at managing this kind of workflow and process.

In the project you'll find the core module, clouder, which installs the clouder concepts in Odoo, and the template modules (like clouder_template_odoo) which installs data and functions specific to each application you want to host. Once you are familiar with Clouder, installing an application is as easy as filling in a form! (Which means you can automatate it with a form on your website).
And the best is, you don't need to research extensively if you want to provide hosting for a new app, just install the template module made by others and you're set.
